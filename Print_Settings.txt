For Housing_Rear:
Recommended FDM Materials: PC-PBT GF, PET CF, to prevent deformation/melting from motor heat.
Alternate Approved FDM Materials: ABS/ASA if your extruder motor keeps cool enough. More testing needed.
Infill Percentage: 100% at least around the motor mount area.

!!! 0.XSC (Squish Compensation) STLs !!!
Use these if your RIDGA gear's hobbed part does not go far enough towards the motor to align with the filament path.
I have had to use all three variants of Housing_Rear for the corresponding units I made with different filament types.
