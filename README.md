# Omni-Micro
Double grip modular extruder, based on [Sherpa Micro](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Sherpa_Micro-Extruder) by Annex Engineering.

## Concept Features
Double grip extruders have existed for a while. They help conventional hotends reach their thermal bottleneck, adding weight and build cost.
Smooth idler extruders, on the other hand, have proved to increase extruson consistency at the loss of grip.



## Design-specific features
- No alteration of leftover original design elements, except for "fusing" two units;
- Flippable design, compatible with most sherpa micro-friendly toolheads (TBD);
- Four driving configurations & three bowden fitting options;
- First layer squish compensation built-in;
