# Omni-Micro
Double grip modular extruder, based on [Sherpa Micro](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Sherpa_Micro-Extruder) by Annex Engineering.
## Concept Features
- Double grip extruders have existed for a while. They help conventional* hotends reach their thermal bottleneck, adding weight and build cost;
- Smooth idler extruders, on the other hand, have proved to increase extruson consistency at the loss of grip;
- I consider this extruder a spiritual successor of the [Sherpa Crew Mini](https://github.com/jrlomas/Sherpa-Crew-Mini) by KR, whom I've been in contact with for a while. I like to think I have improved on the existing formula, while they went for something entirely different, [Mir√≤](https://github.com/jrlomas/miro-extruder).
## Design-specific features
- No alteration of leftover original design elements, except for "fusing" two units;
- Flippable design, compatible with most sherpa micro-friendly toolheads (TBD);
- Four driving configurations & three bowden fitting options;
- Split tensioner with either two regular springs or one cut spring;
- First layer squish compensation built-in (reliability to be confirmed);
- Idler arms and tensioners are compatible with regular Sherpa Micro.
## Future Additions
- Filament sensor.
  I have an idea of how I want to go about it, but I currently don't own any multi-material DIY printers, and the motivation just isn't there.

*Untested with new-generation hotends such as [Chube](https://chubehotend.com/) by Luke's Laboratory.
